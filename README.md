The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the Tetris game are:

1. `Tetromino` class: This class will represent a Tetromino piece. It will have methods to rotate the piece and to get the shape of the piece.

2. `Board` class: This class will represent the game board. It will have methods to check if a move is valid, to place a piece on the board, to check for and clear full lines, and to check if the game is over.

3. `Game` class: This class will control the game flow. It will have methods to start a new game, to handle user input, to update the game state, and to render the game.

4. `main` function: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create a new game and start it.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
